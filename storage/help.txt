Admin commands:
    NAME <name of the node> - Sets name of the node
    ZERO <pin name> - Initialize zero cross detector on specified pin
    PHASESTART <phase start: 0-10000> - sets the time offset of half-phase starting point
    PHASEEND <phase end: 0-10000> - sets the time offset of half-phase ending point
    PULSE <pulse length> - triac steering pulse length in microseconds
    LED <pin name> <mode: PWM, ZERO> - setup a light of type "mode" on specified pin
    SWITCH <pin name> <switch type: 1 2 X> <on close> <on open> - setup an action button (1-single state, 2-states, X-stair switch)
    DISABLE <pin name> - disable previously seatup pin
    PWD <password> - set admins password at a boot time
    BOOTADMIN - no need for admin to login
    WIFI <ssid> <password> - connect to WIFI (not needed on boot time)

Non-admin commands (always available):    
    LOGIN <password> - admin login
    LOGOFF - logoff admin
    URL <url to call> - call web url, http://<ip>/run?file=<script> to run remote script
    TURN <pin name> <new state: 1 0 *> - change state of switch registered under specified pin (also virtual pins: V0, V1, ..., V9)
    SCRIPT <script file> - run script (from local storage)
    SEQ <pin name> - start a light sequence definition under specified pin

Sequence commands (available after starting a sequence):
    VALUE <target value> - instantly assign a value to the light
    DELAY <time of delay> - wait specified number of 1/100 of a second
    SLIDE <time of activity> <target value> - transpose the current light level to the target value within provided time
    REPEAT <no of commands> <no of repeats> - repeat last x commands provided number of times (-1 - inifite)
    END - end current sequence definition

<pin name> can be D0, D1, ..., D9 and in case of switches additionaly V0, V1, ..., V9 for virtual switches available by WIFI
